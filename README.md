## Description

* **Technical aspects**: The judging team would like to hear the answer to these questions when your team will present the final work: Is the project demo ready? What data and API’s did you use for your project? What technical challenges did your team have and how did you solve them? Did you use a particularly clever technique or did you use many different components?
* **Design**: How well is it designed? Did you put thought into the user experience? 
* **Idea**: How creative is your idea? What approach did you follow? How well is it aligned with the hackathon topics?
* **Wow! Factor**: show the jury what is unique about the solution you provided, the way how your team worked or something special about your project

## Note

Don’t forget to share the GitHub repo of your project including the technical work you did and also a README file with these details:

* Name of your team and team members
* Project name
* What problem did you solve
* Short description of your product
